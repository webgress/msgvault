> **Alpha software.** APIs, storage format, and CLI flags may change without notice. Back up your data.

Archive a lifetime of email. Analytics and search in milliseconds, entirely offline.

## Why msgvault?

Your messages are yours. Decades of correspondence, attachments, and history shouldn't be locked behind a web interface or an API. msgvault downloads a complete local copy and then everything runs offline. Search, analytics, and the MCP server all work against local data with no network access required.

Currently supports Gmail and IMAP sync, plus offline imports from MBOX exports and Apple Mail (.emlx) directories.

## Features

- **Full Gmail backup**: raw MIME, attachments, labels, and metadata
- **IMAP sync**: archive mail from any standard IMAP server
- **MBOX / Apple Mail import**: import email from MBOX exports or Apple Mail (.emlx) directories
- **Interactive TUI**: drill-down analytics over your entire message history, powered by DuckDB over Parquet — connects to a remote `msgvault serve` instance or runs locally
- **Full-text search**: FTS5 with Gmail-like query syntax (`from:`, `has:attachment`, date ranges)
- **MCP server**: access your full archive at the speed of thought in Claude Desktop and other MCP-capable AI agents
- **DuckDB analytics**: millisecond aggregate queries across hundreds of thousands of messages in the TUI, CLI, and MCP server
- **Incremental sync**: History API picks up only new and changed messages
- **Multi-account**: archive several Gmail and IMAP accounts in a single database
- **Resumable**: interrupted syncs resume from the last checkpoint
- **Content-addressed attachments**: deduplicated by SHA-256

## Installation

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://msgvault.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://msgvault.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kenn-io/msgvault/releases), verifies the SHA-256 checksum, and installs the binary. You can review the script ([bash](https://msgvault.io/install.sh), [PowerShell](https://msgvault.io/install.ps1)) before running, or download a release binary directly from GitHub.

To build from source instead (requires **Go 1.25+** and a C/C++ compiler for CGO and to statically link DuckDB):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenn-io/msgvault.git
cd msgvault
make install
```

**Conda-Forge:**

You can install msgvault [from conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/msgvault) using Pixi or Conda:

```bash
pixi global install msgvault
conda install -c conda-forge msgvault
```

See the [CLI Reference](https://msgvault.io/cli-reference/) for full details.

## Vector Search

msgvault can search your archive semantically using vector embeddings in addition to the default FTS5 keyword search. Point it at a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio) and three surfaces accept either pure semantic search or BM25+vector fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

- **CLI:** `msgvault search "..." --mode vector` or `--mode hybrid`
- **HTTP:** `GET /api/v1/search?q=...&mode=vector` or `mode=hybrid`
- **MCP:** the `search_messages` tool with a `mode` argument set to `vector` or `hybrid`

A separate MCP tool, `find_similar_messages`, returns nearest neighbors for a seed message. See the [Vector Search guide](https://msgvault.io/usage/vector-search/) for setup, backfill, and troubleshooting.

> **Run only one embedding process at a time.** Don't run `msgvault embeddings build`/`resume` or `repair-encoding` concurrently with a `msgvault serve` daemon — they write the same embedding state, and concurrent writers are not coordinated across processes.

## Importing from MBOX or Apple Mail

Import email from providers that offer MBOX exports or from a local Apple Mail data directory:

```bash
msgvault init-db
msgvault import-mbox you@example.com /path/to/export.mbox
msgvault import-mbox you@example.com /path/to/export.zip   # zip of MBOX files
msgvault import-emlx                                        # auto-discover Apple Mail accounts
msgvault import-emlx you@example.com ~/Library/Mail/V10     # explicit path
```

### Import SMS Backup & Restore for Android (`synctech-sms`)

Msgvault can import XML backups produced by **[SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore)** by SyncTech Pty Ltd. The Android app is listed in Google Play as `SMS Backup & Restore` and uses package `com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore`; the Pro app uses `com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestorePro`.

Install the Android app on the phone that owns the messages, then configure a scheduled backup:

1. Open SMS Backup & Restore.
2. Choose **Set Up A Backup**.
3. Include **Messages**, **MMS media**, and **Call logs**.
4. Choose **Google Drive** as the backup location.
5. Use a dedicated Drive folder for Msgvault imports.
6. Choose **Incremental** backups for daily operation. Full and archive backups also import correctly, but incremental backups keep each daily upload smaller.
7. Schedule the Android backup for a quiet time such as `4:00 AM`.
8. Leave backup encryption off. Msgvault does not import encrypted Pro backups.

Configure Msgvault to read that Drive folder:

```bash
msgvault add-synctech-sms-drive pixel \
  --owner-phone +15550000001 \
  --folder-id 1exampleDriveFolderId \
  --google-account you@gmail.com \
  --schedule "30 4 * * *"
```

The folder ID is the final path segment in a Google Drive folder URL. For example, in `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exampleDriveFolderId`, the folder ID is `1exampleDriveFolderId`.

Run the source immediately:

```bash
msgvault sync-synctech-sms pixel
```

You can also import local files, folders, or unencrypted ZIP backups:

```bash
msgvault import-synctech-sms --owner-phone +15550000001 ~/Downloads/sms-backup.xml
msgvault import-synctech-sms --owner-phone +15550000001 ~/Downloads/sms-backups/
msgvault import-synctech-sms --owner-phone +15550000001 ~/Downloads/sms-backup.zip
```

SMS and MMS messages appear in text-message search. Call logs are imported as searchable call records with `message_type = synctech_sms_call`, so missed and outgoing calls do not mix into normal text threads.

Msgvault stores Google OAuth refresh tokens under the Msgvault home directory with file permissions restricted to the current user. Tokens and client secrets are not written into `config.toml`, logs, README examples, or exported fixtures.

## Configuration

All data lives in `~/.msgvault/` by default (override with `MSGVAULT_HOME`).

```toml
# ~/.msgvault/config.toml
[oauth]
client_secrets = "/path/to/client_secret.json"

[sync]
rate_limit_qps = 5
```

See the [Configuration Guide](https://msgvault.io/configuration/) for all options.

### Multiple OAuth Apps (Google Workspace)

Some Google Workspace organizations require OAuth apps within their org.
To use multiple OAuth apps, add named apps to `config.toml`:

```toml
[oauth]
client_secrets = "/path/to/default_secret.json"   # for personal Gmail

[oauth.apps.acme]
client_secrets = "/path/to/acme_workspace_secret.json"
```

Then specify the app when adding accounts:

```bash
msgvault add-account you@acme.com --oauth-app acme
msgvault add-account personal@gmail.com              # uses default
```

To switch an existing account to a different OAuth app:

```bash
msgvault add-account you@acme.com --oauth-app acme   # re-authorizes
```

### Google Service Accounts

Workspace admins can use a Google service account with domain-wide delegation instead of per-user OAuth tokens:

```toml
[oauth.apps.acme]
service_account_key = "/secure/path/service-account.json"
```

In Google Admin Console, authorize the service account client for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`. If you will run `delete-staged` with permanent deletion, also authorize `https://mail.google.com/`. Keep the key file owner-only, for example `chmod 600 /secure/path/service-account.json`.

```bash
msgvault add-account you@acme.com --oauth-app acme
msgvault sync-full you@acme.com
```

## MCP Server

msgvault includes an MCP server that lets AI assistants search, analyze, and read your archived messages. Connect it to Claude Desktop or any MCP-capable agent and query your full message history conversationally. See the [MCP documentation](https://msgvault.io/usage/chat/) for setup instructions.

## Daemon Mode (NAS/Server)

Run msgvault as a long-running daemon for scheduled syncs and remote access:

```bash
msgvault serve
```

Configure scheduled syncs in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "you@gmail.com"
schedule = "0 2 * * *"   # 2am daily (cron)
enabled = true

[server]
api_port = 8080
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
api_key = "your-secret-key"
```

The TUI can connect to a remote server by configuring `[remote].url`. Use `--local` to force local database when remote is configured. See the [Web Server reference](https://msgvault.io/api-server/) for the HTTP API.
